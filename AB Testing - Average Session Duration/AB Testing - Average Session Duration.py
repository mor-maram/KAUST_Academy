# # AB Testing - Average Session Duration
# 
# Welcome! In this assignment you will be presented with two cases that require an AB test to choose an action to improve an existing product. You will perform AB test for a continuous and a proportion metric. For this you will define functions that estimate the relevant information out of the samples, compute the relevant statistic given each case and take a decision on whether to (or not) reject the null hypothesis.

# ## 1 - Introduction
# 
# Suppose you have a website that provides machine learning content in a blog-like format. Recently you saw an article claiming that similar websites could improve their engagement by simply using a specific color palette for the background. Since this change seems pretty easy to implement you decide to run an AB test to see if this change does in fact drive your users to stay more time in your website.
# 
# The metric you decide to evaluate is the `average session duration`, which measures how much time on average your users are spending on your website. This metric currently has a value of 30.87 minutes.
# 
# Without further considerations you decide to run the test for 20 days by randomly splitting your users into two segments:
# - `control`: These users will keep seeing your original website.
# 
# 
# - `variation`: These users will see your website with the new background colors.
# 
# <a name="2"></a>
# ## 2 - Exploring and handling the data
# 
# Run the next cell to load the data from the test:

# In[3]:


# Load the data from the test using pd.read_csv
data = pd.read_csv("background_color_experiment.csv")

# Print the first 10 rows
data.head(10)


# In[4]:


print(f"The dataset size is: {len(data)}")


# The data shows for every user the average session duration and the version of the website they interacted with. To separate both segments for easier computations you can slice the Pandas dataframe by running the following cell. You may want to revisit our ungraded labs on Pandas if you are still not familiar with it. However, no need to worry because you don't need to be a Pandas expert to complete this assignment.

# In[5]:


# Separate the data from the two groups (sd stands for session duration)
control_sd_data = data[data["user_type"]=="control"]["session_duration"]
variation_sd_data = data[data["user_type"]=="variation"]["session_duration"]

print(f"{len(control_sd_data)} users saw the original website with an average duration of {control_sd_data.mean():.2f} minutes\n")
print(f"{len(variation_sd_data)} users saw the new website with an average duration of {variation_sd_data.mean():.2f} minutes")


# Notice that the split is not perfectly balanced. This is common in AB testing as there is randomness associated with the way the users are assigned to each group. 
# 
# At first glance it looks like the change to the background did in fact drive users to stay longer on your website. However you know better than driving conclusions at face value out of this data so you decide to perform a hypothesis test to know if there is a significant difference between the **means** of these two segments. 
# 
# <a name="3"></a>
# ## 3 - Revisiting the theory
# 
# Let's revisit the theory you saw in the lectures and apply it to this problem. If you are confident with the theory and you feel that you don't need a revision, you may skip this section direct to 1.4!
# 
# Remember that your job is to measure if changing the website's background color leads to an increase of the time visitors spend on it. Rewriting this as hypothesis test, the **null hypothesis** is that the change did not affect the time a visitor spend. Let's name the variables:
# 
# - $\mu_c$ is the average time a user **in the control group** spend in the website. Recall that the **control group** is the group accessing the website without the change in the background color.
# - $\mu_v$ is the average time a user **in the variation groups** spend in the website. Recall that the **variation group** is the groups accessing the website **with the updated background color**.
# 
# Also, recall that your intention is to measure if the background color leads to an **increase** in the time a visitor spend in the website. So writing this experiment as a hypothesis test, the **null hypothesis** is then $H_0: \mu_c = \mu_v$ and the **alternative hypothesis** is $H_1: \mu_v > \mu_c$, or equivalently, $H_1: \mu_v - \mu_c > 0$. 
# 
# Therefore, the hypothesis you will test is:
# 
# $$H_0: \mu_v = \mu_c \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_1: \mu_v - \mu_c > 0$$
# 
# As you saw in the lectures, this is a **right-tailed** test, as you are looking for an increase in the average time. As you saw above, you have more than 2000 users per group, this is a great amount of data so it is reasonable to rely in the Central Limit Theorem that the **average time** for each group follows a normal distribution. Remember that this result is for the group **average time** altogether and not that the time each user spend follows a normal distribution. You don't know the exact distribution for the amount of time a user spend in your website, however, the CLT assures that if we gather enough data, their average time will be very close to a normal distribution whose mean is the average time a user spend in the website. Let's then define two new quantities:
# 
# - $\overline{X}_c$ - the control group **sample mean**.
# - $\overline{X}_v$ - the variation group **sample mean**.
# - $n_c$ - the control group **size**.
# - $n_v$ - the variation group **size**.
# 
# So, by the Central Limit Theorem, you may suppose that
# 
# - $$\overline{X}_c \sim N\left(\mu_c, \left(\frac{\sigma_c}{\sqrt{n_c}}\right)^2\right)$$
# - $$\overline{X}_v \sim N\left(\mu_v, \left(\frac{\sigma_v}{\sqrt{n_v}}\right)^2\right)$$
# 
# Note that with our assumptions of normality, $\overline{X}_v - \overline{X}_c$ also follows a normal distribution. So, if $H_0$ is true, then $\mu_c = \mu_v$ and $\mu_v - \mu_c = 0$, therefore:
# 
# $$\overline{X}_c - \overline{X}_v \sim N\left(\mu_v - \mu_c, \left(\dfrac{\sigma_v}{\sqrt{n_v}}\right)^2 + \left(\dfrac{\sigma_c}{\sqrt{n_c}}\right)^2\right) = N\left(0, \left(\dfrac{\sigma_v}{\sqrt{n_v}}\right)^2 + \left(\dfrac{\sigma_c}{\sqrt{n_c}}\right)^2\right)$$
# 
# Or, equivalently:
# 
# $$\frac{\left( \overline{X}_v - \overline{X}_c \right)}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{\sigma_v}{\sqrt{n_v}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sigma_c}{\sqrt{n_c}}\right)^2}} \sim N(0, 1)$$
# 
# However, remember that **you don't know the exact values for** $\sigma_v$ and $\sigma_c$, as they are the **population standard deviation** and you are working with a sample, so the best you can do is compute the **sample standard deviation**. So you must replace $\sigma_c$ and $\sigma_v$ by the sample standard deviation, respectively, $s_c$ and $s_v$. You also saw in the lectures that replacing the population standard deviation by the sample standard deviation changes the random variable from a Normal to a t-student:
# 
# $$t = \frac{\left( \overline{X}_v - \overline{X}_c \right)}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{s_v}{\sqrt{n_v}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{s_c}{\sqrt{n_c}}\right)^2}} \sim t_d$$
# 
# Where $d$ is the **degrees of freedom** for this scenario. If we suppose that both groups have the same standard deviation, then $d = n_c + n_v - 2$, however there is no argument supporting this supposition, so the formula for the degrees of freedom gets a bit messier:
# 
# $$d = \frac{\left[\frac{s_{v}^2}{n_v} + \frac{s_{c}^2}{n_c} \right]^2}{\frac{(s_{v}^2/n_v)^2}{n_v-1} + \frac{(s_{c}^2/n_c)^2}{n_c-1}}$$
# 
# Once you get the actual value for $t_d$ the, with a given significance level $\alpha$, you can decide if this value falls within the range of values that are likely to occur in the $t$-student distribution (where 'likely' is related with your significance level). To perform this step you must find the value $p$ such that 
# 
# $$p = P(t_d > t | H_0)$$
# 
# If this value is less than your significance level $\alpha$, then you **reject the null hypothesis**, because it means that you observed a value that is very unlikely to occur (unlikely here means that is less than the significance level you have set) if $H_0$ is true.
# 
# Also, remember that $P(t_d \leq t)$ is the $\text{CDF}$ (cumulative distribution function) for the $t$-student distribution with $d$ degrees of freedom in the point $x = t$, so to compute $P(t_d > t)$ you may compute:
# 
# $$P(t_d > t) = 1 - \text{CDF}_{t_d}(t)$$
# 
# Since $P(t_d \leq t) + P(t_d > t) = 1$

# <a name="4"></a>
# ## 4 - Step by step computation
# 
# 
# Wrapping up everything discussed above:
# 
# The hypothesis test is given by:
# 
# $$H_0: \mu_v = \mu_c \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_1: \mu_v - \mu_c > 0$$
# 
# You will start computing:
# 
# - $n_c$ and $n_v$, the control and variation group sizes, respectively.
# - $\overline{X}_c$ and $\overline{X}_v$, the average time spent by the users in the control and variation group, respectively. 
# - $s_c$ and $s_v$, the **sample** standard deviation for the time spend by the users in the control and variation group, respectively.
# 
# With these quantities in hand, the next steps are to compute:
# 
# - $d$, the degrees of freedom of the $t$-student distribution, $t_d$.
# - The $t$-value, which it will be called $t$.
# - The $p$ value for the distribution $t_d$ for the $t$-value, i.e., the value  $p = P(t_d > t | H_0)$.
# 
# Finally, for a given significance level $\alpha$, you will be able to decide if you reject or not $H_0$, depending on wether $p \leq \alpha$ or not.
# 
# Let's get your hands into work now! Run the cell below to retrieve the session times for the control and variation groups.

# In[6]:


# X_c stores the session tome for the control group and X_v, for the variation group. 
X_c = control_sd_data.to_numpy()
X_v = variation_sd_data.to_numpy()


# In[7]:


print(f"The first 10 entries for X_c are:\n{X_c[:20]}\n")
print(f"The first 10 entries for X_v are:\n{X_v[:20]}\n")

# ### Exercise 1
# 
# In this exercise, you will write a function to retrieve the basic statistics for `X_c` and `X_d`. In other words, this function will compute, for a given numpy array:
# 
# - Its size (in your case, $n_c$ and $n_v$).
# - Its mean (in your case, $\overline{X}_c$ and $\overline{X}_v$)
# - Its sample standard deviation(in your case, $s_c$ and $s_v$)
# 
# This function inputs a numpy array and outputs a tuple in the form `(n, x, s)` where `n` is the numpy array size, `x` is its mean and `s`is its **sample** standard deviation.
# 
# Hint: 
# - Recall that the sample standard deviation is computed by replacing $N$ by $N-1$ in the variance formula. 
# - You may compute an array size using the `len`function.
# - Any array in numpy has a method called `.mean()` to compute its mean.
# - Any array in numpy has a method called `.std()` to compute the standard deviation and a parameter called `ddof` where if you pass `ddof = 1`, it will use $N-1$ instead of $N$.

# ### Exercise 4
# 
# In this exercise, you will compute the $p$ value for $t_d$, for a given significance level $\alpha$. Recall that this experiment is a right-tailed t-test, because you are investigating wether the background color change increases the time spent by users in your website or not. 
# 
# In this experiment the $p$-value for a significance level of $\alpha$ is given by
# 
# $$p = P(t_d > t) = 1 - \text{CDF}_{t_d}(t)$$
# 
# 
# Hint: 
# - You may use the scipy function `stats.t(df = d)` to get the $t$-student distribution with `d`degrees of freedom. 
# - To compute its CDF, you may use its method `.cdf`. 
# 
# Example:
# 
# Suppose you want to compute the CDF for a $t$-student distribution with $d = 10$ degrees of freedom for a t-value of $1.21$.

# In[18]:


t_10 = stats.t(df = 10)

# This means that there is a probability of 87% that you will observe a value less than 1.21 when sampling from a $t$-student distribution with 10 degrees of freedom.
